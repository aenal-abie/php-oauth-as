# Changelog

## 0.2.0
- no longer need `fkooman/oauth-common`
- better input validation
- major overhaul of configuration for authentication backends
- entitlements are for now only available through the configuration file, no
  longer through authentication, this was used for the SAML authentication 
  before, but for non of the other authentication libraries
- simplify the consent dialog
- add `php-oauth-as-housekeeping` script to be run from crontab to ocassionaly
  delete expired tokens from the database
- no longer pass the `IniReader` object down the stack, keep all configuration 
  handling it in the `web/` scripts
- refactor DB to accept a `PDO` object in the constructor, no longer provide
  persistent configuration option
- remove remoteStorage automatic client registration support
- no longer support public 'code' clients, i.e. without password so without
  password only `token` type is supported
- rename client types to just `code` and `token` and get rid of the 
  `web_application`, `native_application` and `user_agent_based_application`
  types
- remove resource owner hinting
- update `fkooman/rest-plugin-basic`
- include support to allow clients to be automatically approved (issue #24)
- API calls now always return JSON, also on successful calls to not give
  problems in browser JS parsing
- rename `ClientRegistration` class to `ClientData` and refactor all code 
  to use the object instead of object to array conversion
- allow for using limited regexp as redirect_uri, they still should match 
  valid URI checks (issue #34)
- actually use the matching `redirect_uri` instead of the registered 
  `redirect_uri`
- allow regexp redirect_uris only by setting the explicit configuration 
  option
- remove template customizations from config file and implement template
  override by allowing templates to be placed in `config/views` from 
  `views`
