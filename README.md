# Installation
Please use the RPM packages for actually running it on a server. The RPM 
packages can for now be found in the 
[repository](https://repos.fedoraproject.org/repo/fkooman/php-oauth). For 
setting up a development environment, see below.

# Development Requirements
On Fedora/CentOS:

    $ sudo yum install php-pdo php-openssl httpd'

You also need to download [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/).

The software is being tested with Fedora 20, CentOS 6 and CentOS 7 and should 
also work on RHEL 6 and RHEL 7.

# Development Installation
*NOTE*: in the `chown` line you need to use your own user account name!

    $ cd /var/www
    $ sudo mkdir php-oauth-as
    $ sudo chown fkooman.fkooman php-oauth-as
    $ git clone https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth-as.git
    $ cd php-oauth-as
    $ /path/to/composer.phar install
    $ mkdir data
    $ sudo chown apache.apache data
    $ sudo semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/var/www/php-oauth-as/data(/.*)?'
    $ sudo restorecon -R /var/www/php-oauth-as/data
    $ cd config
    $ cp oauth.ini.defaults oauth.ini

Edit `oauth.ini` to match the configuration. You need to at least modify the
following lines, and set them to the values shown here:

    entitlementsFile = "/var/www/php-oauth-as/config/entitlements.json"
    dsn = "sqlite:/var/www/php-oauth-as/data/db.sqlite"
    simpleAuthPath = "/var/www/php-simple-auth"

Now continue with the configuration:

    $ cp entitlements.json.example entitlements.json

You can modify the `entitlements.json` file to list your own user ID to 
specify the `manage` entitlement. By default the `admin` user ID has this
entitlement.

    $ sudo -u apache bin/php-oauth-as-initdb 
    $ sudo -u apache bin/php-oauth-as-register https://www.php-oauth.net/app/config.json

Copy paste the contents of the Apache section (see below) in the file 
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/php-oauth-as.conf`.

    $ sudo service httpd restart

If you ever remove the software, you can also remove the SELinux context:

    $ sudo semanage fcontext -d -t httpd_sys_rw_content_t '/var/www/php-oauth-as/data(/.*)?'

# Apache
This is the Apache configuration you use for development. Place it in 
`/etc/httpd/conf.d/php-oauth-as.conf` and don't forget to restart Apache:

    Alias /php-oauth-as /var/www/php-oauth-as/web

    <Directory /var/www/php-oauth-as/web>
        <IfModule mod_authz_core.c>
          # Apache 2.4
          Require local
        </IfModule>
        <IfModule !mod_authz_core.c>
          # Apache 2.2
          Order Deny,Allow
          Deny from All
          Allow from 127.0.0.1
          Allow from ::1
        </IfModule>
        
        # CORS
        <FilesMatch "api.php|introspect.php">
            Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "*"
            Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "Authorization, Content-Type"
            Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "POST, PUT, GET, DELETE, OPTIONS"
        </FilesMatch>

        RewriteEngine On
        RewriteCond %{HTTP:Authorization} ^(.+)$
        RewriteRule .* - [E=HTTP_AUTHORIZATION:%{HTTP:Authorization}]

        AllowOverride None
        Options FollowSymLinks

        # CSP: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/CSP
        Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"

        # X-Frame-Options: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/HTTP/X-Frame-Options
        Header set X-Frame-Options DENY

        # HSTS: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Security/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security
        #Header set Strict-Transport-Security max-age=604800
    </Directory>

Restart Apache with `service httpd restart`.

# Authentication
There are two plugins provided for user authentication:

* `SimpleAuthResourceOwner` - Simple static username/password authentication 
  library (**DEFAULT**)
* `SspResourceOwner` - simpleSAMLphp plugin for SAML authentication

You can configure which plugin to use by modifying the 
`authenticationMechanism` setting in `config/oauth.ini`.

You do need to configure these authentication backend separately. See the 
respective documentation for those projects.

## Entitlements
This OAuth server also uses *entitlements*. Entitlements are certain access 
rights a particular user using the API has. For instance, you can configure a
user to have `manage` rights on the API of the Authorization Server. 

These entitlements can be provided either by the authentication backend, in the
case of the `SimpleAuthResourceOwner` backend, or through a static
configuration file in `config/entitlements.json`. 

Entitlements are needed because sometimes you want users to be able to use the
provided API, but not be able to manage client registration, or on some APIs, 
some users have more rights. For instance, a special user can access data for
all users through the API while regular users can only access their own data.

The API for managing the authorization server supports the 
`http://php-oauth.net/entitlement/manage` entitlement in order to be able to 
modify application registrations. If for instance the authentication backend 
supports the users `admin`, `fkooman` and `demo` and you want to give the user
with the ID `admin` the entitlement to manage the application registrations, 
you would put that in `config/entitlements.json`:

    {
        "admin": [
            "http://php-oauth.net/entitlement/manage"
        ]
    }

Now, whenever the `admin` user successfully authenticates it can manage clients
through the API. Users with other IDs will not be able to manage the clients.

## SimpleAuthResourceOwner 
For the `SimpleAuthResourceOwner` backend you also need to install 
[SimpleAuth](https://github.com/fkooman/php-simple-auth/). See the 
instructions there on how to install and configure this. Make sure you set the
correct path for `simpleAuthPath` in `config/oauth.ini`.

## SspResourceOwner
In the configuration file `config/oauth.ini` only a few aspects can be 
configured. To configure the SAML integration, make sure at least the following 
settings are correct:

    authenticationMechanism = "SspResourceOwner"

    ; simpleSAMLphp configuration
    [SspResourceOwner]
    sspPath = "/usr/share/simplesamlphp"
    authSource = "default-sp"
    ;resourceOwnerIdAttribute = "eduPersonPrincipalName"

If you do not set `resourceOwnerIdAttribute` the 'persistent NameID value' will
be requested and used to identify the users on subsequent visits. If this is 
not available, authentication will fail. To work around this, use an attribute
provided by the IdP that uniquely identifies the user. We assume you already
have a working IdP/SP connection. See the simpleSAMLphp documentation for 
more information.

# Management Clients
There are two management clients available:

* [Manage Applications](https://github.com/fkooman/html-manage-applications/)
* [Manage Authorizations](https://github.com/fkooman/html-manage-authorizations/)

These clients are written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript only and can be hosted on 
any (static) web server. See the accompanying READMEs for more information.
For your convenience they are hosted on 
[https://www.php-oauth.net](https://www.php-oauth.net) so you do not need to 
setup the applications yourself and can immediately use the hosted versions. 
Just specify the endpoint to your Authorization Server to get started. They 
also work with the Docker image, you can then use 
`https://localhost/php-oauth-as` as the URL to connect to.

# Resource Servers
If you are writing a resource server (RS) an API is available to verify the 
`Bearer` token you receive from the client. Currently a draft specification
`draft-richer-oauth-introspection` is implemented to support this.

An example, the RS gets the following `Authorization` header from the client:

    Authorization: Bearer 40da7666a9f76b4b6b87969a7cc06421

Now in order to verify it, the RS can send a request to the OAuth service:

    $ curl -k -s https://localhost/php-oauth-as/introspect.php?token=40da7666a9f76b4b6b87969a7cc06421 | python -mjson.tool
    {
        "active": true,
        "client_id": "2352ea44-612d-448b-be10-6e29562e5130",
        "exp": 1409564548,
        "iat": 1409560948,
        "scope": "http://php-oauth.net/scope/manage",
        "sub": "admin",
        "token_type": "bearer",
        "x-entitlement": [
            "http://php-oauth.net/entitlement/manage"
        ]
    }
    
The RS can now figure out more about the resource owner. If you provide an 
invalid access token, the following response is returned:

    {
        "active": false
    }

If your service needs to provision a user, the field `sub` SHOULD to be used 
for that. The `scope` field can be used to determine the scope the client was 
granted by the resource owner.

There are two proprietary extensions to this format: `x-entitlement` and 
`x-ext`. The former one gives the entitlement values as an array. The `x-ext` 
provides additional "raw" information obtained through the authentication 
framework. For instance all SAML attributes released are placed in this 
`x-ext` field. They can contain for instance an email address or display name.

A library written in PHP to access the introspection endpoint is available 
[here](https://github.com/fkooman/php-oauth-lib-rs).

# Resource Owner Data
Whenever a resource owner successfully authenticates using some of the supported
authentication mechanisms, some user information, like the entitlement a user
has, is stored in the database. This is done to give this information to 
registered clients and to resource servers that have a valid access token.
