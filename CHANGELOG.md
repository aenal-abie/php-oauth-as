## [0.2.3] - 2015-02-17
### Changed
- determine the introspect URI automatically for use by the `web/api.php` 
  script instead of hard coding `http://localhost/php-oauth-as/introspect.php`

## [0.2.2] - 2015-02-15
### Added
- include support to allow clients to be automatically approved (issue #24)
- allow for using limited regexp as redirect_uri, they still should match 
  valid URI checks (issue #34)

### Changed
- no longer provide CORS headers on introspect endpoint in httpd 
  config as clients should never use this endpoint
- restructure code to use a separate IO class for random number and time
  handling
- increase code coverage by writing better unit tests

## [0.2.1] - 2015-02-12
### Fixed
- fix refresh_token generation for implicit authorized clients
- fix redirects when client did not put a redirect_uri in the query
  parameters in the authorization request
- API calls now always return JSON, also on successful calls to not give
  problems in browser JS parsing

## [0.2.0] - 2015-02-11
### Added
- add `php-oauth-as-housekeeping` script to be run from crontab to ocassionaly
  delete expired tokens from the database

### Changed
- major overhaul of configuration for authentication backends
- entitlements are for now only available through the configuration file, no
  longer through authentication, this was used for the SAML authentication 
  before, but for non of the other authentication libraries
- simplify the consent dialog
- no longer pass the `IniReader` object down the stack, keep all configuration 
  handling it in the `web/` scripts
- refactor DB to accept a `PDO` object in the constructor, no longer provide
  persistent configuration option
- rename client types to just `code` and `token` and get rid of the 
  `web_application`, `native_application` and `user_agent_based_application`
  types
- rename `ClientRegistration` class to `ClientData` and refactor all code 
  to use the object instead of object to array conversion
- allow regexp redirect_uris only by setting the explicit configuration 
  option
- remove template customizations from config file and implement template
  override by allowing templates to be placed in `config/views` from 
  `views`

### Removed
- remove remoteStorage automatic client registration support
- no longer support public 'code' clients, i.e. without password so without
  password only `token` type is supported

### Fixed
- better input validation
- actually use the matching `redirect_uri` instead of the registered 
  `redirect_uri`
